**Last updated: February 20, 2026**

This Refund and Cancellation Policy applies to all subscription plans offered by Connor Boetig, doing business as MediaSearch ("MediaSearch," "we," "us," or "our"), through the website at [https://www.trymediasearch.com](https://www.trymediasearch.com).

## 1. Cancellation

You may cancel your MediaSearch subscription at any time using either of the following methods:

- **Billing Portal:** Log in to your MediaSearch account, navigate to account settings, and cancel through the billing portal.
- **Email:** Send a cancellation request to boetigsolutions@gmail.com.

There are no cancellation fees. Cancellation requests are processed promptly and you will receive confirmation of your cancellation.

## 2. What Happens After Cancellation

- Your access to paid features and your current subscription tier will continue until the end of your current billing period.
- After the billing period ends, your account will be automatically downgraded to the Free tier.
- You will retain access to your uploaded files and search functionality within the limits of the Free tier.
- For annual subscriptions, cancellation takes effect at the end of the prepaid annual term. You will retain access to paid features for the remainder of the year you have already paid for.
- Cancellation prevents future charges; it does not generate a refund for the current or any prior billing period.

## 3. Refund Policy

**All subscription payments are non-refundable.**

This includes, without limitation:

- Monthly subscription fees
- Annual subscription fees
- Partial or unused billing periods
- Unused file processing quotas or search quotas
- Unused features within your subscription tier
- Periods of service interruption, downtime, or maintenance

No refunds or account credits will be issued for any of the above.

## 4. Exceptions

In rare and extenuating circumstances, MediaSearch may, at its sole and absolute discretion, issue a refund or account credit. Examples of extenuating circumstances may include, but are not limited to, being charged after a confirmed cancellation due to a billing system error.

To request a discretionary exception, please email boetigsolutions@gmail.com with the following information:

- Your account email address
- The date and amount of the charge in question
- A description of the circumstances

All refund exception decisions are made at the sole discretion of MediaSearch and are final. Submitting a request does not guarantee that a refund will be issued.
