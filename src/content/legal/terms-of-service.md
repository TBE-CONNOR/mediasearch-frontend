## 17. Dispute Resolution

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL.**

**Step 1: Informal Negotiation**
Before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding, you agree to first contact us at boetigsolutions@gmail.com and attempt to resolve the dispute informally for a period of at least thirty (30) days. During this period, both parties agree to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. Most disputes can be resolved through informal negotiation, and we encourage you to reach out to us before taking further action.

**Step 2: Binding Arbitration**
If the dispute cannot be resolved through informal negotiation within the 30-day period, either party may initiate binding arbitration. Arbitration shall be conducted in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) then in effect.

- The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator.
- The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
- If the cost of arbitration is deemed excessive by the arbitrator, MediaSearch will cover the arbitration fees to the extent necessary to ensure that the process is not cost-prohibitive for the claimant.

**Class Action Waiver:**
YOU AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION AGAINST MEDIASEARCH.

**Statute of Limitations:**
You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Service or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Any claim filed after this one-year period is permanently barred.

**Litigation (If Arbitration Does Not Apply):**
If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue shall be the state and federal courts located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. You consent to personal jurisdiction in these courts and waive any objection to venue or inconvenient forum.

## 20. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect the remaining provisions of these Terms. The remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect, and the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable while preserving the original intent of the parties.

---

## 21. Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy) and [Refund Policy](/legal/refund-policy), constitute the entire agreement between you and MediaSearch regarding your use of the Service. These Terms supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties, and understandings, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and MediaSearch's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

---

## 22. Updates to These Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. When we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of these Terms.
